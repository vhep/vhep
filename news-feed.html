              An Online Survey To Direct Future Health Economic Research into COVID-19
            </h2>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://teesside.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/an-on-line-survey-to-direct-future-health-economic-researc-2" class="cta-home">Take Part</a>
            <br /><br />
<p class="main-p">
              <h1>What is the purpose of the study?</h1>
              The purpose of this study is to elicit the perceptions and opinions of health economics experts on the direction of future health economic research on the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collected from the survey will be used to develop options (propositions) on priority areas for a larger research study using Delphi exercise to establish consensus on the direction of future research on the Covid-19 pandemic.
              <br /><br />
              <h1>Why have I been invited to take part in this study?</h1>
              We are inviting you to take part because you are a member of the Value in Health Economics & Policy (VheP) Group.
              <br /><br />
              <h1>Do I have to take part?</h1>
              No, it is up to you if you want to or not.
              <br /><br />
              <h1>What would I be asked to do if I chose to take part?</h1>
              If you choose to take part, you will be asked to complete a survey that will take approximately 15 mins to complete. The survey will ask you questions about the foci of future research in terms of demographic and socio-economic groups, types of interventions to curtail the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the trade-offs between different types of interventions. Please note that completion of the survey will be considered as consent to participate in the study.
              <br /><br />
              <h1>What would happen if I started, but changed my mind?</h1>
              You can stop taking part by closing your Internet browser at any time while completing the survey. However, once you have completed and submitted your answers it would not be possible to withdraw your data as the survey data is anonymous (non-person identifiable).
              <br /><br />
              <h1>What are the possible disadvantages, or risks, of taking part?</h1>
              We do not anticipate any major risks or discomfort for people taking part in the survey.
              <br /><br />
              
              <h1>What are the possible benefits to taking part?</h1>
              There are no direct benefits to you from taking part. However, taking part will help us to design the options (propositions) for a Delphi exercise to determine the focus of research/grant applications on responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and contribute to produce knowledge on the matter.
              <br /><br />
              <h1>What would happen to the information collected about me?</h1>
              Anonymous data collected from the survey will be stored indefinitely on a Teesside University (TU) password protected server. This is in the case that other scientists wish to raise questions about the results that need checking against the data. In the event that the study is published, in a scientific journal, the non-person identifiable data may be made publicly available (for example, as a supplement to the journal article, or stored on an on-line scientific data repository such as Mendeley Datahttp://data.mendeley.com/)
              <br /><br />
              Only the researchers will have access to the data from the survey. If you refer to any names of people or places that could potentially identify you or others, these will not appear in any publications or reports.
              <br /><br />
              <i>'Personal data including special category data obtained for the purposes of this research project is processed lawfully in the necessary performance of scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes carried out in the public interest. Processing of personal data including special category data is proportionate to the aims pursued, respects the essence of data protection and provides suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and interests of the data subject in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018'.</i>
