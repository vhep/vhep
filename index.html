              The Value in Health Economics and Policy group is
              interdisciplinary, cross-faculty, multi-institutional and

              of adding value to people’s health and healthcare systems. As a

          We are primarily a research group based in the Newcastle Business
          School and the University of Newcastle (UON), focusing on issues
          related to decision-making and policy-making in healthcare. In order
          to create value across the whole system, we need people researching
          and practicing across many different levels. Therefore, our team not
          only includes classical (health) economic experts, but also experts
          from public and allied health, social science, psychology and more.
          Our members include staff and students of the University of Newcastle
          across the faculties of Business and Law, Health and Medicine, Arts
          and Humanities, Engineering and Built Environment, and Science and we
          welcome new members from all faculties and schools. Our membership is
          also not exclusive to UON and we have both local and global members
          from other Universities, research institutions and industries. See our
          members

        <h1>Research and Practice</h1>
        <p>
          As a group we identify and inefficiencies within the current
          healthcare system, by examining the literature and coordinating with
          healthcare stakeholders, to provide sustainable, value-based
          assessments of health interventions and policies. We investigate not
          only the costs and benefits but also the decision-making processes of
          all involved; healthcare practitioners, patients and policy makers.
          This stakeholder engagement is facilitated through the organisation
          and development of workshops, seminars, and educational programmes for
          both students and external stakeholders, such as members from our
          local and nearby health districts. These programmes occur in
          conjunction with group driven research projects to improve our
          understanding of health related issues and policy implementation.
          <br /><br />
        </p>

        <h1>Teaching and Learning</h1>
        <p>
          In addition to workshops and seminars aimed at external stakeholders
          we also pride ourselves on our higher degree programs conducted
          through the University. VheP has been instrumental in developing the
          new Masters of Health Economics, Management and Policy which will be
          open for students 2021. These courses provide students with a sound
          foundational knowledge as well current, real world and innovative
          information so they can become the next leaders in health economics,
          management and policy and leave a lasting impact. More information
          about these courses can be found
