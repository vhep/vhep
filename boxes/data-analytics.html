            The VheP team has expertise in healthcare data analytics and risk
            management. Examples of the team’s work in this sphere include
            understanding patterns of prevalence of chronic conditions such as
            diabetes or hypertension, optimizing operating room use, calculating
            insurance premiums, or budgeting more accurate government subsidies,

          <h2 class="secondary-heading">Overview</h2>
          <p class="main-p">
            Health sectors across the globe are facing increasing challenges,
            such as aging, increases in the prevalence of chronic conditions,
            and mounting use and preferences towards new technologies.
            Governments, insurers and providers are being pressured to make
            better use of their resources while meeting their populations needs.
            Data analytics and risk management has immense potential in
            addressing these challenges. Examples of the VheP team’s work in
            this sphere include understanding patterns of prevalence of chronic
            conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, optimizing operating
            room use, calculating insurance premiums, or budgeting more accurate
            government subsidies, among others.

          <h2 class="secondary-heading">Research Focus</h2>
          <p class="main-p">
            There are many major industries which use data analytics in their
            daily operations to conduct their business. The health sector,
            however, is behind and fails to make the best use of the vast data
            collected both routinely and through research. VheP aims to join the
            pioneers within healthcare data analytics and combine the expertise
            of its data scientists and heath researchers to use advanced
            statistics, machine learning and big data to bring the healthcare
            sector to the front of this space and ensure efficient use of
            resources and optimal patient outcomes. It will achieve this through
            the following streams of research:

              <h3 class="third-heading">Data Analytics</h3>
              <p class="main-p">
                There is a huge amount of data collected both routinely and
                through research practices within the healthcare sector. However
                this data is often very complex; covering multiple large
                databases with redundant and missing data. Using this data
                effectively requires sophisticated analyses such as machine
                learning, data linking and complex modelling to extract the key
                information. When successful these techniques allow improved
                optimisation, efficiency and patient outcomes across both the
                entire health system and its individual components.

                Regulatory and institutional frameworks
              </h3>
              <p class="main-p">
                As healthcare systems and financing moves towards a more value
                based approach, and as the use of data analytics and shared big
                data become more prevalent, proper risk management within
                healthcare becomes increasingly important. Changes to
                institutional frameworks, hospital expansions or mergers, more
                integrated care across the community and so on all create risks,
                both financially and to patient care. Careful consideration and
                analysis of these risks is crucial to ensuring healthcare and
                the system continue to function optimally and efficiently.
