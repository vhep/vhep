            In addition to the focus on consumer led initiatives, another
            important aspect of health systems reform is the overall management
            and organisation of the health system. The VheP team’s
            internationally recognised scholars are experts in many aspects of
            health systems organisation, including the interaction between

          <p class="main-p">
            Healthcare systems’ design and decision-making in OECD countries are
            mostly ad hoc and reactive. The role of optimal regulation and
            incentives in this context is, therefore, critical and would benefit
            from informed, evidence-based decision and policy making. The VheP
            team’s work in this area has been recognised for its innovation,
            consistency, influence and academic rigour, with insightful
            contributions to health economics and policy; combining conceptual
            analysis with empirical applications to address contemporary policy
            questions within the following themes:

              <p class="main-p">
                The healthcare sector grows massively every year. The financing
                is a crucial dimension to face the increase of the costs.
                Financing a health system is concerned with the mobilization,
                accumulation and allocation of money to cover the health needs
                of the people, individually and collectively, in the health
                system. The purpose of health financing is to make funding
                available, as well as to set the right financial incentives to
                providers, to ensure that all individuals have access to
                effective public health and personal health care. It also
                encompasses a significant interaction between public and private
                schemes.

                Regulatory and institutional frameworks
              </h3>
              <p class="main-p">
                Health is a complex topic that involves several dimensions.
                Despite their different paths of reform, everywhere countries
                share, in broad terms, common objectives of access, fairness in
                financing, and efficiency in both the health insurance products
                and in healthcare provision. Analysing regulatory and
                institutional frameworks helps to allocate resources fairly and
                efficiently to funders/providers.
