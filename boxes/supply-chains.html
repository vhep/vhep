            The VheP team’s internationally recognised scholars are experts in
            many aspects of health systems organisation, including the
            interaction between public and private financing schemes, and
            regulatory and institutional frameworks and incentives. The team’s
            work has focused on the organisation and empirics of healthcare,
            aged care and long-term care insurance and financing in Australia,
            Europe, Asia and the Middle East; the role of markets, institutions,
            regulatory and governance frameworks; and the impact of
            stakeholders’ decision-making on the affordability and efficiency of
            healthcare services.

          <h2 class="secondary-heading">Overview</h2>
          <p class="main-p">
            When they work, supply chains and their associated networks are
            virtually invisible as they unobtrusively go about business, but
            when they do not, we quickly discover how reliant the world has
            become on the almost seamless flows of materials and services and
            the interconnectedness they provide. The recent coronavirus pandemic
            has exposed the fragility of these supply chains caused by
            unanticipated spikes in global demand and stockpiling of supplies by
            consumers, which resulted in a systematic disruption for consumers,
            health centres, businesses, and governments. The researchers at VheP
            have taken an unprecedented interdisciplinary approach to explain
            how human behaviour can be included into the modelling of supply
            chain systems in order to better estimate the impacts of disasters
            and pandemics on the health system and beyond. Previous work by the
            team has focused on numerous aspects of these systems across
            business, healthcare and the military.

          <h2 class="secondary-heading">Research Focus</h2>
          <p class="main-p">
            Until recently nearly all research into supply chain systems around
            the world had been disciplinary specific. However, our researchers
            are breaking out of this siloed approach by adopting behavioural and
            psychological theories into this deterministic field of study, which
            extends the beyond the traditional borders of the internal systems
            to include consumer and external shocks into the process. The group
            aims to lead the creation of this new field to deliver research that
            targets more robust and resilient supply chain systems, through the
            following themes:

              <p class="main-p">
                A consideration of human behaviour is critical to properly
                understanding and efficiently managing supply chains and their
                impacts. There are many psychological and behavioural phenomena
                such as heuristics, biases and incentives which can all affect
                management decisions and consumer behaviour in ways that may
                seem irrational and unexpected if not understood or anticipated.
                A behavioural approach to supply chain systems incorporates
                these distinctly human factors resulting in a more optimal
                system and, when applied to healthcare, better outcomes for
                patients.

                Supply Chains and Operations Management
              </h3>
              <p class="main-p">
                Expertise in operations and supply chain management is necessary
                for the design, execution, and management of efficient supply
                chains. This is fundamental to safeguarding the future of
                Australia’s health system, economy, environment, and communities
                against disruptions from pandemics such as Covid-19, bushfires,
                floods, drought and other disasters. Efficient supply chain and
                operations management ultimately leads to improved service
                delivery and consumer satisfaction.

                Disaster Relief
              </h3>
              <p class="main-p">
                Managing supply chains can be challenging under ‘business as
                usual’ settings, however when disaster strikes this task becomes
                both more complex and more important. Factors unique to
                disasters and crises such as greater uncertainty of resources
                and greater reliance on donations and volunteers, which often
                lack supply chain management expertise, contribute to this
                increased difficulty in effective supply chain management in
                disasters. Supply chain management for disaster relief
                incorporates these unique factors into traditional supply chain
                knowledge ensuring optimal management under the most difficult
                situations, ultimately leading to substantial benefits in
                individual and global health.
